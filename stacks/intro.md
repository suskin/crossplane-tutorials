Welcome! This tutorial will guide you through how to create a
[Crossplane Stack][stack-docs]!

It is roughly equivalent to the quick start guide in the [Crossplane CLI
documentation][crossplane-cli-quick-start], but interactive.

The first thing that will happen is we will set up some things on the
machine and initialize an empty project. This is happening **right now**
for you!
